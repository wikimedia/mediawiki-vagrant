# = Class: logstash
#
# Logstash is a flexible log aggregation framework built on top of
# Elasticsearch, a distributed document store. It lets you configure logging
# pipelines that ingress log data from various sources in a variety of formats.
#
# == Parameters:
# - $heap_memory_mb: amount of memory to allocate to logstash in megabytes.
# - $pipeline_workers: number of worker threads to run to use for
#                      filter/output processing
#
# == Sample usage:
#
#   class { 'logstash':
#       heap_memory_mb => 128,
#       pipeline_workers => 3,
#   }
#
class logstash(
    $heap_memory_mb,
    $pipeline_workers,
