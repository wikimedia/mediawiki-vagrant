# == Class: role::eventlogging
# This role sets up the EventLogging extension for MediaWiki such that
# events are validated against schemas in srv/schemas/event, but logged locally.
#
# EventGate will be installed and run, and events will be produced via eventgate.
#
# By default, eventgate will output events to the /vagrant/logs/eventgate-events.json
# log file, or to whateverÂ the eventgate::output parameter is set (in hiera).
# If eventgate::output == 'kafka', Kafka will be installed and events will
# be produced to Kafka.
