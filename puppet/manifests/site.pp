# == Mediawiki-Vagrant Puppet Manifest
#
# This manifest is the main entrypoint for Puppet, the configuration
# management tool that sets up this machine to run MediaWiki. The
# manifest specifies which classes of services should be enabled on this
# virtual machine.

# For more information about resource defaults in Puppet, see
# <http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/2.7/reference/lang_defaults.html>.

# By adding a stage => 'first' / 'last' parameter to your class
# declaration, you can tell Puppet to instantiate the class (and its
# resources) at the very beginning of its run or the very end. See:
# <http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/2.7/reference/lang_run_stages.html>
stage { 'first': } -> Stage['main'] -> stage { 'last': }

# Human-readable constants which may be used in lieu of literal numbers
# for specifying loading priority of resource types which support this
# notion (like mediawiki::extension, mediawiki::settings, and mediawiki::wiki).
$load_first  = 0
$load_early  = 5
$load_normal = 10
$load_later  = 15
$load_last   = 20

# Declare global '$::realm' for modules that are shared with Wikimedia's
# operations/puppet.git tree (e.g. nginx).
$realm = 'vagrant'

# Declares a default search path for executables, allowing the path to
# be omitted from individual resources. Also configures Puppet to log
# the command's output if it was unsuccessful. Finally, set timeout to
# 900 seconds, which is three times Puppet's default.

    logoutput => on_failure,
    timeout   => 900,

}
