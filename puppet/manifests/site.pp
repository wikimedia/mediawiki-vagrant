# == Mediawiki-Vagrant Puppet Manifest
#
# This manifest is the main entrypoint for Puppet, the configuration
# management tool that sets up this machine to run MediaWiki. The
# manifest specifies which classes of services should be enabled on this
# virtual machine.
#
# By default, the Mediawiki-Vagrant virtual machine is configured to run
# a plain MediaWiki instance, with some small enhancements designed to
# make it easy to hack on MediaWiki code. However, MediaWiki-Vagrant
# knows how to configure a machine to fulfill various other roles which
# are not enabled by default.
#
# To enable an optional role, simply uncomment its declaration below by
# removing the leading '#' symbol and saving this file. Then, run
# 'vagrant up' to ensure your machine is active, and then 'vagrant
# provision' to apply the updated configuration to your instance.
