## MediaWiki-Vagrant

http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Mediawiki-vagrant

MediaWiki-Vagrant is a portable MediaWiki development environment. It consists
of a set of configuration scripts that automate the creation of a virtual
machine that runs MediaWiki.

The virtual machine that MediaWiki-Vagrant creates makes it easy to learn
about, modify, and improve MediaWiki's code: useful debugging information is
displayed by default, and various developer tools are set up specifically for
inspecting and interacting with MediaWiki code, including a powerful debugger
and an interactive interpreter. Best of all, because the configuration is
automated and contained in a virtual environment, mistakes are easy to undo.


## Prerequisites

You'll need to install recent versions of Vagrant and VirtualBox.

 * VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
 * Vagrant: http://downloads.vagrantup.com/

Next, you'll need a copy of the mediawiki-vagrant project files.

 * zip: https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-vagrant/archive/master.zip
 * tar.gz: https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/gitweb?p=mediawiki/vagrant.git;a=snapshot;h=HEAD;sf=tgz
 * Git: `git clone https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/mediawiki/vagrant`


## Installation

If you download the zip file or tarball, you will need to extract it to a
directory of your choice. Once you do that, open up a terminal or a
command-prompt, and change your working directory to the location of the
extracted (or git-cloned) files. From there, run `vagrant up` to provision and
boot the virtual machine.

You'll now have to wait a bit, as Vagrant needs to retrieve the base image from
Canonical, retrieve some additional packages, and install and configure each of
them in turn.

If it all worked, you should be able to browse to http://localhost:8080/ and
see the main page of your MediaWiki instance.


## Usage

To access a command shell on your virtual environment, run `vagrant ssh` from
the root mediawiki-vagrant directory or any of its subdirectories.

From there, run `phpsh` to interactively evaluate PHP code in a MediaWiki
context, or `mysql` to get an authenticated SQL shell on your wiki's database.

The admin account on MediaWiki is `admin` / `vagrant`.
